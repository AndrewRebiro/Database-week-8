# Database-week-8
PROJECT TITLE:
A Library Management System
The Library Management System database is designed to efficiently manage various aspects of a library's operations, including the tracking of books, authors, patrons (borrowers), and the books borrowed by patrons. It stores detailed information about books, such as title, genre, and author, with a unique ISBN identifier for each book. Authors are tracked by their first and last names, allowing books to be associated with their respective authors. The patrons table captures details of library members, including their names and email addresses, ensuring each patron has a unique identifier. The loans table tracks the borrowing activity, linking books to patrons along with the loan and return dates. This ensures that no book can be borrowed more than once by the same patron on the same day. The system uses relational database design to enforce data integrity and maintain efficient organization, allowing the library to manage its resources effectively.
RUNNING THE PROJECT:
 set up and run the Library Management System project, begin by installing MySQL on your machine. You can download MySQL from the official website and ensure that both MySQL Server and a MySQL client, such as MySQL Workbench, are installed. Once MySQL is set up, create a new database to store the library systemâ€™s data by executing the following SQL commands: CREATE DATABASE LibraryManagement; followed by USE LibraryManagement;. Next, import the provided SQL script (library_management.sql) that contains the necessary CREATE TABLE statements to define the structure of the database and sample data insertion queries. You can do this by opening the .sql file in MySQL Workbench, copying its contents, and executing the script in the query window.

After running the script, verify that the tables (Authors, Books, Patrons, and Loans) have been successfully created by executing SHOW TABLES;. You can further check that the sample data has been correctly inserted by querying each table with SELECT * FROM <TableName>;. Once the database is set up, you can begin interacting with it by adding new books, updating patron information, or recording loans. Additionally, if you wish to integrate the database into a web application, you can use technologies like PHP, Node.js, or Python (with frameworks such as Flask or Django) to build a user interface for managing the library system. With these steps, the Library Management System will be fully operational, allowing you to manage books, patrons, and loan records efficiently.
